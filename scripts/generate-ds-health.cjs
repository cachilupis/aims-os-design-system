/**
 * generate-ds-health.cjs — AIMS OS Design System
 *
 * Builds src/ds-health.json, the data behind the DS Health page in the
 * catalog. Two inputs, joined here:
 *
 *   audit-tokens.cjs --json   every finding (generated, never edited)
 *   ds-decisions.json         what we decided about each one (hand-kept)
 *
 * Runs the same audit that CI and .husky/pre-push run, so the page can never
 * disagree with what actually blocks a push.
 *
 * Why the decisions live in their own file: a finding without a verdict gets
 * re-litigated every time someone new sees it. The Stepper case — a local
 * `Stepper` that was a numeric input, flagged as shadowing the DS wizard
 * `Stepper` — was correctly left alone, and without a written record the next
 * person would ask again. The page's value is the verdict column, not the list.
 *
 * Spacing warnings are excluded: 39 of them, informational by design, and they
 * are not DS-consistency decisions. They stay in the terminal audit.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/generate-ds-health.cjs   (or npm run generate:ds-health)
