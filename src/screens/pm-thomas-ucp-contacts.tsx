/**
 * UCP — Contacts list.
 *
 * The entry point into the Unified Contact Profile. One roster for the three
 * record types AIMS OS keeps profiles for — People, Employees and Companies —
 * because the profile behind them is the same surface either way.
 *
 * Records arrive through ingestion and account sync, and can also be created
 * here. The Header's primary CTA names the entity type of the active tab —
 * Create New Contact on All, then Person / Employee / Company — because a
 * generic "Create" on a roster of three types does not say what it will make.
 *
 * A record created here has no `source`: source is the system a record was
 * pulled FROM, and per the Entity Header spec the slot is removed rather than
 * refilled when the entity was created in the platform itself.
 *
 * Navigation: Tabs (record type) → Filters. Cards are the only layout in this
 * version — the DS's SwitchTab is not shown by default and a table view is not
 * in scope yet. Row click opens the profile; the Eye opens a preview without
 * leaving the list.

/**
 * ── The tab bar at seven entity types ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Tabs work while there are few types and stop working when there are many,
 * and "many" arrives on its own: an entity type is whatever Helix Data Studio
 * publishes, so this roster starts at Customers / Employees / Companies and
 * ends up with repair orders, policies and assets beside them.
 *
 * The answer is the one Salesforce, HubSpot and Notion all landed on: the bar
 * shows a SUBSET the user chooses, and a `+` adds the rest. Salesforce calls
 * it "Add More Items", HubSpot caps pinned views and puts the rest behind a
 * menu, Notion gives each tab a `···`. None of them tries to show everything.
 *
 * Two rules make it safe rather than clever:
 *   · the picker IS the manager — one checkbox list does show AND hide, so
 *     there is no second "remove tab" flow to find
 *   · the tab you are on is never hidden, and the bar never empties
 *
 * The cap is 6, HubSpot's mechanic: past it, adding asks you to remove. A bar
 * that wraps to a second line is not a bar any more, and unlimited tabs is how
 * every one of these products ended up needing a picker in the first place.
 *
 * Past ~12 types this stops being enough and the type belongs in the Sidebar,
 * with the tabs left as the user's own shortlist. That threshold is a decision
 * to take when it arrives, not to build for now.

 * four types are kept at five so that one roster does not open two different
 * surfaces depending on which tab you were standing on.
 *
 * Trimming was the price of that, and each cut went to a field the record
 * gets somewhere better: an employee's access role is set in People & Access,
 * a company's primary contact is a link you make once both records exist, and
 * headcount is a number that arrives from the sync rather than from a form.

// The roster concierge lived here — a SlideOut chat opened by an `Ask` button

// unreachable surface in the file and an unused import behind it. The record's
// own concierge is untouched — it opens from the Entity Header's `Ask`, which
// is a different thing: that one answers about one record from its own planes.
// ── Create ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/**
 * ── Creating a contact is a full page with a Stepper ───────────────────────
 *
 * THIS SURFACE HAS MOVED TWICE, and both moves are worth keeping written down
 * because the reasoning is what makes the current one right rather than just
 * newest.
 *
 * It began as a `SlideOut`, justified with "a create form is non-destructive,
 * so it is a SlideOut and not a ModalDialog". That is not the test — the
 * Create pattern's test is whether the user can ignore the surface and keep
 * working in the background — so it became a `ModalDialog variant="content"`,
 * which is where the cascade lands a standalone five-field create.
 *
 * Michael then asked for stages (2026-09-10), and stages change the answer
 * outright. The pattern's staged-flows table has exactly two rows: one stage
 * is a panel, and "two or more stages, or any branching" is a full-page wizard
 * with `Stepper` and `StepperNavFooter`. There is no `Stepper` inside a modal
 * and no `StepperNavFooter` inside a panel, so this is not a preference.
 *
 * WHY THE STAGES ARE NOT PADDING ON FIVE FIELDS. They are three different
 * questions, and the first one is a gate:
 *
 *   1 · Identity   Who is this, and does the platform already know them?
 *                  The duplicate check lives here and BLOCKS here. A known
 *                  duplicate should never be carried through two more stages
 *                  to be refused at the end.
 *   2 · Details    How to reach them and who owns the relationship.
 *   3 · Review     What is about to be written, and what happens to it. A
 *                  record created by hand starts on the Sandbox Plane rather
 *                  than arriving attested from a source system, and that is a
 *                  governance consequence — it gets stated before the button
 *                  that causes it, not in a toast afterwards.
 *
 * NO SIDEBAR for the duration (`hideSidebar`) — the pattern's own rule for
 * full-page create surfaces, so the only ways out are the Header's back arrow
 * and the footer's Cancel. `Header` carries a title and `backButton` only; the
 * flow completes in the footer and never in the bar.

      hundred is a scrollbar and a reader hunting alphabetically. Typing is the
      only interaction that stays the same size as the list.

      Substring matching, not prefix, and case-insensitive: somebody looking
      for Priya Nair types "nair" as readily as "priya".

      // Select, a trigger with no text entry. Composed here from Input + Menu

/**
 * ── The category rail ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-11: the entity types can grow a long way, so the category
 * choice moves out of a tab bar and into a rail to the LEFT of the list — like
 * SidePanel, but without a container card, with an expand/collapse control and
 * a divider on its right edge, and with a search so somebody can find a
 * category instead of scanning for it.
 *
 * WHY A TAB BAR WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BREAK HERE. A tab bar is horizontal, so it
 * is bounded by the width of the screen — which is why this one grew a `+`
 * picker and a cap of six, and why the picker existed at all. Both of those
 * were workarounds for a shape that does not scale, and both go: a vertical
 * list has as many rows as it needs, and a search field is what replaces the
 * cap when the list gets long. Nothing is hidden behind a preference any more.
 *
 * ── COMPONENT INVENTORY, taken before anything was written ──
 *
 *   SidePanel   the closest thing, and it is not this. It is an overlay-ish
 *               panel with its own surface, a title, a menu and a footer, and
 *               Michael's instruction was explicitly "without a container
 *               card". Borrowed its BEHAVIOUR — the collapsed strip, the
 *               right border — not its chrome.
 *   Sidebar     the app's own nav, at the far left. Two of those on one
 *               screen is two navigations competing; this rail is a filter,
 *               not navigation, so it is not that component either.
 *   MenuItem    REUSED, one per category: leadingIcon, label, subtext, a
 *               trailing count and a selected state. It is already the row
 *               the `+` picker used, so a category looks the same wherever
 *               it is listed.
 *   Input       REUSED for the search, with its own leftIcon.
 *   Tooltip     REUSED for the collapsed rail, where a row is an icon and an
 *               icon-only control without a label is unreadable.
 *
 * NAMED EntityCategoryRail, not CategoryRail: the Widget Marketplace already
 * has a `CategoryRail` and it is a different thing — business-function
 * categories with colour dots. Two screens declaring one name is exactly the
 * drift the duplicate-component check exists to catch, and the fix is a name,
 * not a shared abstraction: these two rails have nothing in common but a
 * shape.
 *
 * WHAT I ADDED: this function. It is a column with a border and a list — a
 * composition of four DS components in a screen file, which is the case
 * CLAUDE.md says NOT to turn into a component. If a second screen wants a
 * category rail, that is when it earns a file in experimental/.

  ── The rail's spacing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Michael, 2026-09-11: reduce the padding, 12px or less.

  space was everything ELSE around it: a 56px collapsed rail holding a 28px
  icon, and a 24px gap on the other side of the line. Together that was ~88px
  of chrome to the left of the first card, most of it empty.

  44 + 8 + 12 = 64. The icon keeps its own hit area, the divider still reads

        for the COLLAPSED rail — 44px of icons has nowhere to put one, and a
        reader scanning six glyphs is not searching. Expanded is a different
        surface: the labels are there, the list will grow past what anybody
        scans, and a size-sm field costs one row.

        It filters CATEGORIES. The field over the list filters RECORDS. They
        never compete because they are never both the obvious thing to type
        into — one sits inside the rail, the other spans the list.

    // recommendation here fits in 54 characters or fewer, so the row gets the
    // hugging card and no disclosure — matching the block inside RecordHeader
    // on the profile, which carries no chevron either.
    //
    // The rationale is deliberately not here. A roster is scanned to decide what
    // to open next, and the proposal plus its timestamp answers that; the "why"

        THE TAB BAR AND THE FILTERS BAR ARE BOTH GONE — Michael, 2026-09-11:
        "no es necesario mantener el componente de filters y tabs, ya que eso
        lo abordaremos en el Sidebar que va a la izquierda del contenido de
        lista."

        The tab bar went because it could not grow: horizontal means bounded
        by the screen, which is why it had sprouted a `+` picker, a cap of six
        and a per-user preference in localStorage — three mechanisms to hide
        the fact that the shape does not scale. A vertical rail has as many
        rows as it needs and a search instead of a cap.

        WHAT LEFT WITH THE FILTERS BAR, stated plainly because it is a real
        subtraction and not a tidy-up: the record search, the per-type facet
        slots (Status, Owner), All filters and sort. The rail replaces the
        CATEGORY half of that and nothing else. Michael's own words are that
        filtering will be addressed in the rail — future tense — so this is
        the intermediate state, not the finished one. Everything removed is
        one component call site to restore, and the state behind it (applied,
        sortKey, openSlot, the FiltersSlideout) is still wired.

            THE FILTERS BAR IS BACK, ABOVE THE LIST — Michael, 2026-09-11.

            Taking it out with the tabs was the wrong half. The rail answers
            "which KIND of record", which is a navigation question and belongs
            on the left; search and the facets answer "which of THESE", which
            is a question about the list you are looking at and belongs over
            it. Removing both left the roster with no way to find a person by
            name, which is the single most common thing anybody does here.

            It sits inside the right column rather than above both, so it
            spans the list it filters and not the rail it does not.
