/**
 * Thom's entities, from the two places he keeps them.
 *
 * His published prototype shows three Salesforce entities with column counts
 * and per-column definitions. His own screen in this repo
 * (pm-thomas-composable-dashboards.tsx) carries five more across Zendesk,
 * BambooHR and AIMS OS, with the integrations each one can also come from.
 * Both are his and neither is complete on its own, so both are here: the three
 * with column definitions are the ones the page features, and the rest live
 * behind Browse all entities.
 *
 * `featured` is what the page shows. Everything else is one click away rather
 * than absent — which is also what his "More entities available" note meant.

 * tried first and does not work here: Select renders a div, and base-ui's
 * Trigger could neither attach to it nor stop reading the click as a dismiss.
 * The pattern the repo actually runs on — anchorFromEvent + useDropdownPosition
 * + a full-screen click-catcher — is what Filters uses, so this matches the
 * codebase instead of introducing a second dropdown mechanism.
 *
 * The screen needs this three times (filters, calculations, group by), which is
