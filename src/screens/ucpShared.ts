 *
 * Three AIMS OS concepts are modelled here rather than invented:
 *   - Knowledge planes (Truth 100% / Sandbox ~80% / Sources ~60%) — the same
 *     three planes a TruthPack is built from. The Snapshot tab is this record's
 *     facts organised by plane, so "how sure are we" is readable at a glance.
 *   - Source Drives — drives, folders or documents attached from the company
 *     catalog. This is what the profile's Drives tab lists (it replaces the
 *     generic "Documents" tab a CRM would have).
 *   - The Entity Header content model (Figma 19815-101547) — visual, title,
 *     source, state badge, signal and classification tags, secondary metadata.
 *     Every field below maps to a named slot in that spec; nothing is a
 *     convenience field invented for this screen.

 * reads "Book the overdue 40,000 km service".
 *
 * That is the Repair Orders problem again, wearing a different type. He had
 * already taken repair orders out for the same reason — "no hace sentido" in
 * Contacts — and the asset came back carrying repair-order CONTENT. A truck
 * with an overdue service is not something anybody scanning a contacts list
 * is looking for, and one row like it teaches the reader that this list is
 * "records" rather than "people and the organisations they belong to", which
 * is the whole premise of the module.
 *
 * POLICIES GO WITH IT, and he did not have to say so: a policy is not
 * somebody you contact either. It was in All for the same reason the asset
 * was — because All meant "every row in CONTACTS" rather than "every contact".
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: the types are not deleted, and their tabs still work. A
 * reader who deliberately opens Assets is asking for assets and gets them,
 * repair-order next-best-actions included, because there that is the record's
 * own business. The change is only that All stops mixing them in — "all" is

/**
 * Governance's three axes, applied to one fact.
 *
 * DERIVED, and only from things the fact already says about itself — its plane
 * and when it was last verified. That is the honest version: a Truth fact
 * verified last month is verified; one that has gone stale is due to expire;
 * a Sandbox claim has not been reviewed yet. Nothing here is a number somebody
 * made up to fill a filter.
 *
 * The staleness window is 60 days, which is the same order as the Risk study's
 * own "older than 90 days" freshness rule on this record.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE DATES ARE SPREAD ACROSS FOUR MONTHS, and why they must stay
 * that way (2026-09-10). They were all clustered inside one fortnight, which
 * meant nothing was ever stale — so every Truth fact rendered Verified / Low
 * risk and every Sandbox claim Pending review / Medium, and the three
 * Governance filters the Knowledge tab offers each had exactly one value to
 * offer. A filter that cannot change what you see is worse than no filter: it
 * says the axis exists and then proves it does not.
 *
 * The dates are not decoration either. Each one is a fact that plausibly goes
 * stale: a phone number read off an email signature in June, because nobody
 * re-reads a signature; a title from a CRM sync that has not run since May; a
 * priority stated on one call and never corroborated. Do not normalise them.

 * ── Create: the edge cases, before anything is created ─────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-10: "consideremos casos borde como qué pasa si este existe,
 * como se mostrará, usando un informative card, en el caso que ya exista el
 * usuario o contactos poder mostrar los correos o contactos asociados a ese
 * mail o dato."
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE ONE EDGE CASE WORTH BUILDING FIRST. A unified profile whose
 * whole promise is one record per person has exactly one way to break that
 * promise, and it is this form. The Activity feed on every record already
 * carries the evidence — "Record merged from duplicate · absorbed a duplicate
 * created by the inbound form" — so the duplicate is not hypothetical here,
 * it is a thing that has already happened to this data and was cleaned up
 * afterwards. Catching it before the record exists costs a lookup; catching
 * it afterwards costs a merge, and a merge is a governance event.
 *
 * WHAT IS SHOWN, AND WHY IT IS THE RECORDS THEMSELVES. "This email already
 * exists" is not actionable — the reader cannot tell whether they are about
 * to duplicate a record or whether somebody else's typo is in the way. So the
 * card carries the MATCHED RECORDS, each with the datum that collided, which
 * is the difference between a validation error and an answer.
 *
 * ONE CARD, STRONGEST SIGNAL WINS. Three stacked cards in a 900px modal is
 * noise, and the reader only ever acts on the most severe one. The order below
 * is by how certain the collision is, not by how bad it sounds:
 *
 *   email-active    An active record already holds this email. CERTAIN — an
 *                   email is the one field this data treats as unique. Blocks.
 *   email-archived  Same, but the record is archived. Also certain, and the
 *                   answer is to restore rather than create. Blocks.
 *   phone           A phone matches and the email does not. NOT certain: a
 *                   switchboard, a shared mobile, a household. Warns only.
 *   name            A name matches and nothing else does. Weak — two people
 *                   are allowed the same name. Informs only.
 *   domain          Nothing matched, but the email's domain belongs to a
 *                   company on file. This is not a duplicate at all, it is
 *                   the good case: the new contact has a parent, and saying
 *                   so before the save is how it gets linked without anyone
 *                   going back to do it. Informs only.
 *
 * The three lower cases never block. A create form that refuses a real second
 * person at the same company has stopped being a safeguard and become a wall,
 * and the person filling it in is the one who knows which it is.

   PROFILE — the dispositional layer
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Michael, 2026-09-11. Intelligence answered what is happening and what to
   do, and never answered WHO THIS PERSON IS. Everything sat at one level of
   abstraction — events and actions — so every signal read as a loose fact and
   the reader had to assemble the model themselves. That, not the volume, is
   what made the section feel complex.

   THE ARCHITECTURAL RULE, and it is the one that keeps this honest:

     A trait INFERRED from behaviour lives in Intelligence.
     A trait ATTESTED through KCON lives in Overview.

   When a trait is attested onto the Truth Plane it stops rendering here and
   graduates. Intelligence shows what the system BELIEVES; Overview shows what
   the organisation STANDS BEHIND. That is why `source` exists on a trait and
   why it is not cosmetic.

   THE COPY TEST, which governs every string below: if Sandra read her own
   profile, she would have to RECOGNISE herself, not feel diagnosed. So these
   are observations in the third person and the present tense — "Asks for
   written proof", never "Prefers documentation" and never anything about what
   she feels. No personality framework, no clinical language, no emotional
   state. A profile of a person is a thing that person should be able to read.

   NOTHING IS SCORED. An archetype is a NAME — "Cautious Evaluator" — never
   "Caution: 72". A number on a person is a judgement wearing a decimal point,
   which is the same reason there is no risk score on a contact.
