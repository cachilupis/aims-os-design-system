/**
 * UCP — Unified Contact Profile (detail view).
 *
 * Read-only by design: the record is assembled by ingestion and agents, not
 * typed in here, so there is no create CTA. The one always-present entry point
 * is Ask — RecordHeader's own agent trigger — which opens the record's
 * assigned concierge in a side panel.
 *
 * The identity card is the DS's own RecordHeader. An earlier build of this
 * screen used a purpose-built EntityHeader instead, on three arguments: that
 * RecordHeader branched on three closed record shapes, that it carried the Next
 * Best Action inside itself where the Figma spec wanted a separate card below,
 * and that it had no state coverage. All three stopped being true. RecordHeader's
 * agnosticism pass dropped the closed variants, its redesign reintroduced the
 * Next Best Action deliberately as a protagonist block, and it now carries
 * per-zone loading and per-field masking. So this screen was rebuilt around what
 * the design system has rather than beside it, and the second component is gone.
 *
 * Two things that used to be ours belong to the component now, and both are
 * better there: the Next Best Action, which no longer needs placing, and the
 * card-width reflow, which RecordHeader measures on its own box.
 *
 * What stays ours is the chrome around it. The identity card and the tabs pin in
 * ScreenLayout's header zone, outside the scroll container, so the record stays
 * identified while its content scrolls.
 *
 * One deviation from CLAUDE.md's generic detail-page rule, and it is deliberate:
 * the page Header does NOT repeat the entity name, status tag and breadcrumb.
 * The Entity Header spec makes its own title the page subject ("the title
 * carries the profile heading level"), and the Figma view for this surface
 * shows only the parent list above the card. Printing the name and state twice,
 * 40px apart, is the thing that spec is avoiding.
 *
 * The states are exercised here rather than described:
 *   Loading     → the first paint of a record fetch, re-armed per record id.
 *   Restricted  → a record whose values sit behind a scope the viewer does not
 *                 hold. Decided by the session against the record, never by a
 *                 flag on the record: `locked` on the header, `masked` on each
 *                 governed field, and a body that follows. Leaving the facts on
 *                 screen under a header that says the values are governed would
 *                 be the page contradicting the header.
 *
 * Tabs: Overview · Snapshot · Activity · Drives
 *   Overview  → WidgetCanvasView (DS rule: any tab named Overview is a canvas)
 *   Snapshot  → this record's facts by knowledge plane (Truth / Sandbox / Sources)
 *   Activity  → interaction timeline, paginated
 *   Drives    → the Source Drives attached to this record

 * Last Activity Widget (catalog id `activity`, class 3 — Heavy, 9 GU).
 *
 * THE SAME ANATOMY THE LIBRARY DRAWS, which is the point: this used to be a
 * list with bottom dividers, a status Tag per row and a tertiary "View full
 * timeline" button under it — recognisably not the DS widget, which is what
 * Michael caught (2026-09-09). The catalogued widget is a stack of BORDERED,
 * CLICKABLE rows: a tinted icon tile, the title, then the time and a chevron
 * on the right, the description on its own line indented past the tile, and a
 * metadata row that appears on hover. 4px between rows, and the whole thing
 * scrolls inside the slot.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the library's renderer, both because this
 * one has real data behind it:
 *   · the tile is HighlightIcon rather than a hand-drawn 26px square — the
 *     audit's own rule, and it keeps a channel the same colour everywhere
 *   · the row opens the Activity tab, where this record's full trace lives,
 *     instead of a SlideOut with sample tabs
 *
 * Communication channels only, which is the widget's own rule — *"Don't mix
 * non-communication activity types in this widget: use Timeline for lifecycle
 * events."* Agent and system events are lifecycle, so they stay on the
 * Activity tab. Empty is a real state: a record whose only events are the
 * robot's own has genuinely never been contacted, and saying so is more useful

  AiSummaryContent lived here — the full-width purple card at the top of every

  and the component went with it: nothing else rendered it, so keeping it would
  have left a dead export and an unused AiSummaryWidget import behind, which is
  the orphan the DS audit exists to catch.

  Where its content went, and why that is not a loss: Intelligence is the tab
  that holds the agent's read of a record, with the signals, the evidence and
  the queue that follow from it. A paragraph-length version of the same
  interpretation on Overview meant one fact rendered in two tabs, and the
  Overview copy was the one you could not act on — a summary whose only
  affordance is "Ask the concierge" is a summary that could not finish its own
  sentence. The concierge is untouched and still opens from the Entity Header's
  Ask, and toAiInsights still feeds the roster's own preview panel and the
  Widget Builder's AI Summary preview, so neither is orphaned.

/**
 * ── Intelligence ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One AI tab for what the system THINKS about this record (Michael,
 * 2026-09-10). The content is modelled on where the industry landed, checked
 * rather than remembered:
 *
 * · SALESFORCE EINSTEIN shows a score as a TIER with a DIRECTION — "High",
 *   "Medium", "Low" plus an arrow when it moves a tier — never a bare number,
 *   and it publishes how the score was computed. It also has KEY MOMENTS:
 *   notifications for the handful of things that actually changed the picture,
 *   like a competitor being mentioned or a sponsor leaving.
 * · GAINSIGHT's Customer 360 leads with a health scorecard and then names
 *   RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES as separate lists, so the two are found rather
 *   than inferred, and hangs CTAs off them.
 *
 * Both put the same three things first: where does this stand, what should I
 * do, what changed. So the order here is score → recommended action → key
 * moments → the reasoning → the drivers behind the score. "Why" comes after
 * "what to do", because a reader who agrees with the recommendation never
 * needs the reasoning and a reader who disagrees needs all of it.
 *
 * WHAT AIMS OS ADDS, and what makes this more than a scorecard: every read
 * carries the AREA it is about, a CONFIDENCE, and a destination — and the
 * knowledge behind it is auditable one tab over, on Knowledge. Einstein tells
 * you the score; this tells you which plane the claim came from.
 *
 * Every number is computed from THIS record. Nothing here is a placeholder,
 * and each card says what it was derived from — a score whose derivation is
 * invisible is a score nobody can argue with, which is the same as one nobody
 * trusts.
 */

/* OPPORTUNITY_AREAS and riskTier lived here, and both went with the rebuild.
   riskTier turned a 0–100 score into High / Elevated / Low for a card at the
   top of this tab — the tiering was the right instinct and the SUBJECT was
   wrong. There is no aggregate risk score on a contact any more: a number
   computed on a human being is a judgement wearing a decimal point, it cannot
   be verified and it cannot be disputed. Named signals replaced it, each one
   with a duration and a link to its evidence. Where a score exists at the
   OPPORTUNITY level it can be shown here as an inherited, linked value —
   an opportunity is a commercial object and can carry one. */

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   INTELLIGENCE — rebuilt 2026-09-10 to Michael's spec.

   A rep opens a contact and needs to decide what to do about that person,
   NOW. This is a working surface, not a reading surface: work is resolved
   here, not just displayed. Every block earns its place against that.

   Block order is fixed and nothing sits above the verdict:

     1 Verdict          two sentences — who they are, and the imperative
     2 Signals          named, verifiable conditions, one line each
     3 Suggestion queue prioritised, workable, items leave when resolved
     4 Agent reads      candidate claims, and what can be attested

   WHAT WAS REMOVED, and why each removal is a subtraction of noise rather
   than of information:

   · The Risk / Opportunities / Recommendations metric cards. A card that
     counts to one is worse than naming the thing it counted — "Opportunities
     1" tells you less than the opportunity's own title would have. Risk
     became signals; the other two became the queue.
   · "Recommended next" as its own block. It is row one of the queue.
   · The duplicate rendering. One item used to appear in four places — as a
     risk factor, as a recommendation, as "recommended next", and as a key
     moment. Each fact now renders in exactly one block and the others link
     to it.
   · "See it as a task" as a link. It is Accept, a primary action, and it is
     the gesture that creates a task.
   · Every confidence percentage. A number with no scale answers a question
     nobody asked.
   · The aggregate risk score ON THE CONTACT. A number computed on a human
     being is a judgement wearing a decimal point. Where a score exists at
     the opportunity level it is shown as an inherited, linked value.

                        internally; no caller slot        EXTENDED (below)

     inline empty state EmptyState                        reused
     disclosure         none in ui/; ProcessItem has showExpand but is a
                        timeline step                     used EntityList's

     confirmation       ModalDialog variant="confirmation" reused

   THE ONE EXTENSION: `EntityListItemData.expandable` — a controlled
   `{ expanded, onToggle, content }` slot. The two existing expansions own
   their state internally and render text only; a queue's expanded row is a
   drafted reply, its grounding links and its actions, and the queue has to
   be able to open a row programmatically. Extended, not forked.

/**
 * ── Progressive disclosure ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-11. The spec this section was built to said WHAT to show
 * and never said what is visible AT ONCE, so all four blocks rendered
 * expanded and the section read as a wall. Nothing was removed here — what
 * changed is what is open when you arrive.
 *
 * THE GOVERNING RULE: one thing open at a time, and nothing hides silently.
 * Every collapsed block states its weight in its own header — an exact count
 * plus its most significant item — so a reader can skip it on purpose rather
 * than by accident. A collapsed section has to tell you whether the click is
 * worth it.
 *
 * DEFAULT ON LOAD
 *   Verdict          open, always, never collapsible
 *   Suggestions      three rows, exactly one expanded
 *   Signals          one line
 *   Agent reads      one line
 *
 * THE ACCORDION HAS TWO SCOPES, and the difference is the point. Between
 * blocks, opening Signals closes Agent reads and vice versa — but neither
 * touches the queue, because the queue is the working surface and work you
 * cannot see is work you will not do. Inside a list, one row at a time.
 *
 * IT RESETS ON EVERY VISIT. This state is component-local and the tab
 * unmounts when you leave it, which is the implementation of "focal state is
 * a guarantee, not a user preference" — a reader who expanded four things
 * last time should still arrive at one.
 *
 * ── COMPONENT INVENTORY, taken before anything was written ──
 *
 *   collapsible section  NOTHING in src/components/ui/. No Accordion, no
 *                        Disclosure, no Collapsible. ProcessItem has
 *                        showExpand but it is a timeline step with a
 *                        connector line, not a section header.
 *   expandable rows      EntityList.expandable — the controlled slot added
 *                        for the queue on 2026-09-10. REUSED for signals and
 *                        agent reads, which is why all three lists now open
 *                        the same way and none of them needed a chevron of
 *                        its own.
 *   clickable surface    CardContainer's own `onClick`, which already sets
 *                        role="button" and tabIndex. The block header is a
 *                        CardContainer, so the disclosure control is a DS
 *                        component rather than a <div> with a handler.
 *   counters             Tag, existing semantic variants.
 *
 * WHAT I ADDED: `DisclosureBlock` below — a local composition, not a new
 * component file. It is a CardContainer header plus a conditional body, which
 * is exactly the case CLAUDE.md says to compose in the screen rather than put
 * in ui/. If a third screen needs it, that is when it earns a file.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED 2026-09-11. DisclosureBlock wrapped each collapsed block in a
 * CardContainer, which is a box drawn around a sentence. Signals and Agent
 * reads are now a line of text with a chevron and no container at all — the
 * disclosure behaviour survives, its chrome does not.
 */
/* QUEUE_SORT_MIN_ROWS and READS_FILTER_MIN went with the controls they

/**
 * ── Profile and verdict, as one block of prose ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-11. The content was right and the CHROME was the problem:
 * seven nested containers and fourteen pills in the default state. At that
 * density a pill stops meaning anything — it is just the shape text comes in —
 * and the page reads as a wall however good the words are.
 *
 * The reference is Lightfield, Fibery and Tana: a record sheet is plain text,
 * grey labels and plain values, no boxes. A container is reserved for the
 * thing you can act on, which here is exactly one thing — the expanded
 * suggestion.
 *
 * SO THE TRAITS ARE PROSE. Chips are for filtering; prose is for
 * understanding, and nobody filters a contact by "quiet on calls". Five chips
 * became one sentence, and the sentence is shorter than the chips were.
 *
 * ATTESTATION IS SAID IN WORDS, NOT COLOUR. "— inferred" in grey at the end of
 * the archetype line. Colour alone communicates nothing without a legend, and
 * this block has no room for one; a trait that IS attested gets an underline
 * on its own words, which is an affordance rather than a paint job.

 * budget allows exactly one container in the default state and spends it
 * here, on the row you can act on.
 *
 * NOTHING NESTS INSIDE IT EITHER. The held state was an InformativeCard and
 * the draft was a bordered box, so the expanded row was three boxes deep. The
 * held state is one line with the explanation behind `Why?`, and the draft is
 * a typographic quote — a rule down its left edge, no border, no fill. It is

/**
 * ── The Governance preview, as one component ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-11: the Sandbox, Truth Plane and Drives previews should
 * carry the same information Governance's own item previews carry, expressed
 * with the components from the SlideOut/SidePanel — Content page.
 *
 * READ OFF THE REAL THING this time, not off a filter bar. The Governance
 * Studio prototype is public — lexpaniagua-prod.github.io/governance-studio-V1
 * — so the earlier note in this file about working from screenshots is
 * settled. Its item preview is four sections under two tabs:
 *
 *   Overview │ Details
 *
 *   AI SUMMARY            a generated paragraph, then an arrow line that is
 *                         the imperative: "→ Review 8 pending claims and renew
 *                         5 expiring facts before the next audit cycle."
 *   WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION  counts with a link each — Facts expiring soon 5
 *                         Review →, Pending human review 8 Open queue →,
 *                         Active proposals 9 View →
 *   GOVERNANCE HEALTH     confidence distribution, human-validated share,
 *                         audit completeness, conflict rate
 *   ACTIONS & SHORTCUTS   Open Review Queue, View Expiring Facts, Go to
 *                         Promotions, Open Knowledge, View Activity Log
 *
 * HOW IT MAPS ONTO THE DS PAGE'S ZONES, which is the part that is a decision
 * rather than a transcription:
 *
 *   AI Summary           → zone 1, the purple card. Same position, and that
 *                          page also puts it first, so nothing had to move.
 *   Governance health    → zone 2, the HighlightCard grid, three cards.
 *   What needs attention → zone 3, a list section: EntityList rows, each with
 *                          its own action. Governance renders these as counts
 *                          with a link each — "Facts expiring soon 5 Review →"
 *                          — and a link is the whole point of the row, so the
 *                          grid was the wrong home for it: HighlightCard has
 *                          no onClick, and giving one a click target the
 *                          component does not own is how a card becomes a
 *                          button nobody can style consistently.
 *
 * THE TWO ARE SWAPPED relative to Governance, which leads with attention. The
 * DS page's order is explicit — "content always follows this fixed order,
 * never rearrange" — and it puts the metric grid above list sections. Michael
 * asked for Governance's INFORMATION in that page's components, so where the
 * two disagree the page wins on layout and Governance wins on content.
 *   Actions & shortcuts  → tertiary Buttons under a section header.
 *   Details tab          → zone 7, the two-column DetailTable.
 *
 * ONE HONEST DIFFERENCE, and it is the reason this is not a copy. Governance's
 * rows are PLANES — "12 facts, 5 expiring, 8 in review, 9 proposals". Ours are
 * single facts, claims and drives, one level down. A single fact has no count
 * of itself, so where Governance shows a number this shows the thing: the
 * attention flags the fact actually carries, from the same three-word
 * vocabulary Governance filters on. The sections, the order and the language
 * are theirs; the scope is this record's.
 *
 * THE CONFIDENCE PERCENTAGE IS NOT COPIED. Governance shows "95% confidence"
 * and this does not, for the same reason Intelligence dropped it and the
 * Knowledge rows dropped it: it was derived from the plane, restating the
 * plane. A state label carries the same meaning and can be argued with.

/**
 * ── The note preview ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-10: a note opened from the Activity feed gets Overview and
 * Details tabs, built from the SlideOut/SidePanel — Content page's vocabulary.
 *
 * WHY A NOTE IS THE ONE ACTIVITY ROW WITH A PREVIEW. Every other row in that
 * feed is already whole: a call row carries its duration, its outcome and the
 * agent's read of it, and opening it would show the same four facts again. A
 * note row carries a FIRST LINE. The note is somewhere else, and so is the
 * thing that makes it matter on this record — the claims it pushed into the
 * Sandbox plane, each now waiting on a source. That is content the row has
 * nowhere to put, which is what earns the Eye.
 *
 * THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE TABS is what was written versus what the system did
 * with it. Overview is the note: the agent's read of it, the body as typed,
 * the claims it produced and the records it names. Details is the note's
 * metadata: who wrote it, where, when, who can see it. Somebody who opened
 * this to read the note should not have to walk past a provenance table to
 * reach the first sentence, and somebody auditing the scope should not have
 * to scroll three paragraphs to find it.
 *
 * ORDER INSIDE OVERVIEW follows that page's fixed content order — AI Summary
 * first, then list sections — with one deliberate departure: the BODY sits
 * second, between the summary and the lists. The body is not a zone in that
 * vocabulary at all; it is the record itself, and a panel that puts a
 * three-card metric grid above the thing the reader opened it to read has the
 * order backwards. The claims are the list section, and they come after.
 *
 * CONSISTENCY WITH GOVERNANCE. `scope` is one of SANDBOX_SCOPES and each
 * claim's status is one of TRUTH_STATUSES — the same words, with the same
 * meanings, as the Sandbox and Truth Plane shelves in the Knowledge tab, and
 * as the live Governance views those came from. A note is a Sandbox artefact,
 * so it is described in Sandbox's language rather than in a vocabulary this
 * panel invented for itself.

        He is right, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of

        those cards did — Sandbox (3) · Truth Plane (5) · Drives (6) — so the

        not a summary of the section; it is the section's own navigation drawn
        twice, once in a form you cannot click.

        What the cards did carry and the tabs do not is the confidence line
        ("agents treat as absolute"). That is a property of the PLANE, not of
        this record, and it belongs where a reader meets a plane for the first

           The facts were a Table and the drives were an EntityList, which made
           one segmented control switch between two different kinds of object:
           a table is columns you compare down, a list is items you act on one
           at a time. On this shelf you act — a claim gets previewed, chased,
           and eventually attested — so the list is the right shape and the
           table was the odd one out.

           What the columns carried is not lost, it is re-ranked. A row leads
           with the fact and its value, then Governance's own axes: status,
           risk and, when there is one, the attention flag that is the reason
           somebody would open it. */
