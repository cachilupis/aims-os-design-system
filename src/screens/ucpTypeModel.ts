/**
 * The per-type model for the UCP — what a Customer, an Employee and a Company
 * each publish, read by both surfaces: the profile takes its tabs and its own
 * Overview widget from here, the roster takes its filter facets.
 *
 * One module for both because they are one fact. A type that publishes a
 * Department field should be filterable by it and should show it on the record;
 * splitting that across two files is how the list and the profile end up
 * disagreeing about what a type is.
 *
 * ── Ported from the entity-workspace experiment ───────────────────────────
 * The experiment's central claim was that a profile should be driven by the
 * MODEL rather than by the screen: the same code renders a vehicle and a
 * customer, and they differ only in what their type published. That claim does
 * not need twelve types to be worth having — it is already true of three.
 *
 * The evidence was sitting in the fixtures the whole time. `UcpContact.subtitle`
 * is documented as "role · department, or industry · size · HQ", which is three
 * different field sets wearing one string:
 *
 *   Customer   Head of Compliance · Legal · Meridian Corp
 *   Employee   Account Director · Revenue · Chicago, IL
 *   Company    Automotive Retail · 640 employees · Tampa, FL
 *
 * Flattening those into one metadata line was the screen deciding that every
 * type has the same shape. It does not. This gives each type back its own
 * fields and, where the data supports it, its own tab.
 *
 * ── The spine stays universal ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Overview · Snapshot · Activity · Drives are the same on every type, because
 * they are about KNOWLEDGE rather than about the thing: every record is
 * ingested, claimed about, interacted with and documented. What the type adds
 * is the domain.
 *
 * ── A type with nothing to add still renders ──────────────────────────────
 * Customer and Employee get no extra tab, and that asymmetry is the point
 * rather than an omission: a company's roster of people is real data the
 * fixtures already carry, and a customer has no equivalent. Inventing one to
 * make the three types symmetric would be the screen deciding the model's
 * shape again, in the other direction.

 * ── What a type's Overview is made of ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Michael, 2026-09-10: "usar diferentes widgets para cada caso para que no se
 * muestren siempre los mismos".
 *
 * Every type used to draw the same canvas in the same order — the type's own
 * field widget, then Governance, then Risk, then Connections, then Recent
 * activity, each one column wide. Only the CONTENT of the first one changed,
 * so a fleet asset and a VP of Operations opened to the same page furniture,
 * and the widget that mattered most for each of them sat in whichever slot the
 * loop happened to reach.
 *
 * So the composition is published by the type, the way its fields and tabs
 * already are. A `CanvasEntry` is a widget the screen knows how to build plus
 * the span it gets HERE — the same Risk study is one column on a customer,
 * where the relationship carries the risk, and two on an asset, where the
 * asset's own condition IS the record.
 *
 * `self` means the type's own field widget, so a type can place it rather than
 * always leading with it. Studies named here still disappear when the record
 * has nothing for them (`contact.governance === "empty"` and friends) — the
 * order is the type's, the presence is the record's.
