/**
 * Dropdown anchoring — AIMS OS Design System
 *
 * One rule, one implementation. Confirmed by Michael (2026-09-02):
 *
 *   A dropdown's LEFT edge aligns with its trigger's LEFT edge, 4px below —
 *   never centred on the trigger, never at the mouse position. If the panel
 *   would run off the right of the viewport, it flips: RIGHT edges align
 *   instead. The flip is automatic, not a per-screen decision.
 *
 * The same holds vertically, and for the same reason. A panel opened near the
 * bottom of the window used to run past it and simply end — a nine-column list
 * showing three, with nothing to say the rest existed. It now flips ABOVE the
 * trigger when there is more room there, and whichever side it lands on, its
 * height is capped to the space actually available and the list scrolls inside
 * it. Flip alone is not enough: a short viewport has no room on either side, so
 * the cap is what makes "never cut off" true rather than usually true. This is
 * the flip + shift + size behaviour every floating-UI library converges on.
 *
 * The previous rule centred the panel (`translateX(-50%)`), which reads fine
 * on a narrow trigger and badly on a wide one, and pushes a long panel off
 * screen near the right edge. Tooltips and the Slider thumb still centre on
 * their anchor — that is correct for them, and this helper does not apply.
 *
 * Panels here are `w-auto`, so the width is not known until the panel is in
 * the DOM. The hook measures it before paint (useLayoutEffect) and flips in
 * the same frame, so the user never sees it jump.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   const [anchor, setAnchor] = useState<DropdownAnchor | null>(null)
 *   const { ref, style } = useDropdownPosition(anchor)
 *
 *   onClickCapture={(e) => setAnchor(anchorFromEvent(e))}
 *
 *   {anchor && <div ref={ref} style={{ position: "fixed", zIndex: 10001, ...style }}>…</div>}
