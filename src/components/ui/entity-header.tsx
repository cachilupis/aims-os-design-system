/**
 * Entity Header — AIMS OS Design System
 *
 * Source of truth: Figma `Design System - AIMS OS`, node 19815:101548. Every
 * rule below is from that section — the Anatomy, Rules, Hierarchy, Focus
 * order, TAG ROLES, TRUNCATION, THE THREE ACTIONS and BEHAVIOUR blocks.
 *
 * Renamed from `record-header.tsx` on 2026-09-08. The change spec had frozen
 * the old file name while the API was still moving; with the component
 * settled, Michael's call is that it is called Entity Header everywhere —
 * file, exports and page id. The old page id still resolves, see
 * PAGE_ID_ALIASES in App.tsx: links to `?page=record-header` were shared
 * before the rename and must not break.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 *
 * The identity card for a Unified Entity Profile. It identifies the entity
 * you are looking at and surfaces what needs attention. It carries no detail
 * — detail lives in the tabs below it. It answers four questions, in order:
 * what is this, where did it come from, what needs attention, what can I do.
 *
 * ONE SKELETON, EVERY ENTITY TYPE. There is no `variant` prop and no closed
 * set of types. Employee, Customer, Vendor, Patient, Borrower, a repair
 * order, a platform data entity — all the same shape. An entity type this
 * file has never heard of is the normal case, not a gap.
 *
 * THE SLOTS
 *
 *   Row 1   visual · title · source · │ · tags        —  ⓘ · state badge ·
 *                                                        secondary · Ask · ···
 *   Row 2   description (off by default)
 *   Row 3   secondary metadata, max 6
 *
 * The right side is fixed and never compressed. The left side yields, in this
 * order: tags collapse to `+N`, then source, and only then does the title
 * truncate. Nothing wraps and nothing abbreviates.
 *
 * DROPPING IS THE LAST RESORT, and only these two slots ever get dropped:
 * the description below 420px of card width, then the secondary metadata row
 * below 320px. Visual identity, title and state badge are never dropped at
 * any width. Note the ORDER IS REVERSED from Figma's own priority list on
 * Michael's call — metadata carries the facts someone might act on, the
 * description is the edge case for extra granularity — so the description
 * goes first and the metadata row survives longer.
 *
 * NINE TAB STOPS, SIX WHEN NOTHING IS TRUNCATED. Tags and secondary metadata
 * are each ONE stop, not one per item: Tab enters the group, arrows move
 * inside it, Tab leaves. One stop per item would put a dozen and a half Tab
 * presses between a keyboard user and the page, which is a barrier, not an
 * inconvenience. Since the tag cap came down to two, the six-item metadata
 * row carries most of that argument on its own. The title and the description are
 * stops only when they actually overflow — a value that fits has nothing to
 * reveal.
 *
 * THREE STATES, ONE AXIS. `state` is Figma's `Property 1`: default, loading
 * (a skeleton matching the current layout — never an empty state, because
 * saying "nothing here" while data is in flight states something untrue) and
 * restricted (50% opacity; the viewer lacks entitlement to the values, which
 * is a governed state and never an error). Independent of the reflow below —
 * an entity can be loading on a tablet.
 *
 * REFLOW BEFORE YIELDING. Below 720px of measured card width the identity row
 * stacks — title on its own row, source and tags together on the next, right
 * cluster unchanged — which is Figma's `Size = Responsive`. The trigger is
 * the CARD's own width, measured with a ResizeObserver, not the viewport: this
 * header sits in panels and split views, so a wide screen tells you nothing
 * about how much room it actually has.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * NO INSIGHT SECTION. System interpretation reaches this card only as a tag
 * with a tooltip — never a descriptive sentence, never a score with drivers,
 * never an expandable analysis. Anything larger belongs to the Overview.
 *
 * NO DISCLOSURE. This is a fixed arrangement of slots, not a collapsible
 * card. An earlier revision of this file had a chevron revealing two zones,
 * AGENTIC SYSTEM and YOUR INTERVENTION; neither exists in the Figma and both
 * are gone. Their content belongs to Overview widgets.
 *
 * NO NEXT BEST ACTION. The recommendation card is a separate component in
 * its own Card Container — `NextBestActionCard` in
 * @/components/ui/next-best-action-card — rendered as a SIBLING
 * below this one. Two records, two containers. Passing recommendations into
 * the header is the single most common mistake with this card, so the prop
 * does not exist to be misused.
 *
 * NOT A LIST ROW. An `EntityList` row navigates to the detail on click. This
 * cannot — you are already in the detail. It also has no selection, no
 * pinning, no hover-revealed affordances and no virtualization, none of which
 * apply to a single instance. If the header looked like a row, the reader
 * would lose the signal of where they are.
 *
 * GOVERNANCE CANON — AIMS OS law, not preference
 *
 *   Law 1 — Authority and origin of every field is ALWAYS visible. Every
 *     RECORD field carries a FieldProvenance; no code path renders a value
 *     without its source.
 *   Law 2 — Every governed answer carries provenance reachable WITHOUT
 *     leaving the view. The ⓘ trigger opens the Information panel from right
 *     here.
 *   Law 3 — HTL items are first-class states with calm, explanatory
 *     language, never red errors.
 *   Law 4 — PII resolves only at display time, per viewer entitlement. A
 *     hydrated field and a masked field are the SAME RecordField in two
 *     states; this component renders whichever it is given and never
 *     resolves entitlements itself.
 *
 * THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE BUGS AND ARE NOT
 *
 *   - `Ask` shares the Sparkle glyph with the Next Best Action card.
 *     Deliberate (Michael, 2026-09-07): both are AI surfaces and the shared
 *     mark is what says so — one converses, the other transacts. Figma's
 *     prose argues they should differ; Figma's own component instances share
 *     it. Do not "fix" this.
 *   - `assignedAgent` is required but may be `null`. Null renders the same
 *     button, disabled, with a Tooltip — never a silently missing button.
 *   - `Ask` uses `variant="main"` inside a CardContainer. It is the one named
 *     exception in the whole design system, confirmed by Michael. Do not
 *     extend it to any other button.
 *   - A classification tag appears only when the visual is an avatar. A
 *     highlight icon already names the type.
 *   - `recordFields` is on the props interface but this component never reads
 *     it: the Information panel that explains those fields is host-rendered.
 *   - `Minimum`, one of the states Figma names, needs no implementation. It
 *     is "only visual, title and state" — which is what you already get by
 *     passing only those props. Nothing to switch on.
 *   - `restricted` renders at 50% opacity — Figma's own variant — PLUS a
 *     `Restricted` Tag beside the title with the reason in a Tooltip. The
 *     Tag is deliberately BEYOND Figma's instance (Michael, 2026-09-07):
 *     the prose asks for "calm and explanatory" and the instance carries
 *     nothing explanatory, and opacity alone cannot be told apart from
 *     loading or failed.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT IMPLEMENTED
 *
 *   - The ellipsis rule Figma cites from Carbon and PatternFly — an ellipsis
 *     must hide at least three characters and leave at least four visible.
 *     Michael's call (2026-09-07): dropped. CSS cannot count characters, so
 *     it would mean measuring every string on every render, and nobody ships
 *     it that way.
 *
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED YET — do not mistake these for oversights
 *
 *   - The 720px reflow threshold is a calibrated estimate, not a number
 *     Figma states. Figma models Responsive as a variant with no breakpoint
 *     attached; 720 is where the built wide instance stops fitting.
 *   - The explanatory half of `restricted`. Figma's prose asks for "calm and
 *     explanatory" and its instance carries no explanatory element, so the
 *     explanation is screen-reader-only. Making it visible is a design
 *     decision, not an implementation one.

// ── Field-level provenance (Law 1 + Law 2) ──────────────────────────────────
// Every RECORD field carries exactly this — never a bare value with no
// traceable source. `systemAbbr` is the short badge label (e.g. "WD"); the
// Tooltip on that badge (and the Data Provenance SlideOut, Law 2) both read
// from the same object, so the two surfaces can never drift out of sync.

//
// Block 4 — this is the ONLY field shape RECORD ever renders, for ANY entity

//
// Rules that prevent drift, from the Figma block of the same name:
//   - A site inherits its parent company's brand. It is not a separate mark.
//   - Initials are NEVER derived from a code. `RO-48291` has no initials, so
//     a code-titled record uses `kind: "icon"` by definition. The component
//     cannot police this — a caller passing `avatar` with a code as the name
//     gets nonsense initials, and that is the caller's bug.
//   - The icon's colour is assigned per entity TYPE and stays the same
//     everywhere in the product. Pass the same `variant` for the same type on
//     every surface.
//   - The rule is about the entity, not about whether the asset exists. A
//     company with no logo still uses `avatar`, falling back to initials.

// and the only one that gets the full semantic colour range.
//
//   signal          Something that needs attention, bounded in time or in
//                   condition. Zero or many. "Access review", "Renewal at

// ORDER REVERSED FROM FIGMA, ON MICHAEL'S CALL (2026-09-07). Figma's
// visibility priority puts description at 6 and secondary metadata at 7,
// which drops METADATA first. Michael's ruling is the opposite: metadata is
// what you reach for first and it carries the facts someone might act on;
// description is the very edge case for extra granularity when metadata is
// not enough. So the description goes first and the metadata row survives
// longer. The remaining order is Figma's, untouched: source and tags yield
// long before either of these, and visual identity, title and state badge
// are NEVER dropped at any width.
//
// Both numbers are calibrated estimates, same as REFLOW_WIDTH — Figma states
// the order but no breakpoint for it. 420 is where a one-line description
// stops being able to hold a sentence worth reading (roughly 45 characters,
// the bottom of the comfortable reading range). 320 is a SlideOut at its

/**
 * HOW MANY TAGS THE ROW ACTUALLY HAS ROOM FOR.
 *
 * `ENTITY_HEADER_TAGS_MAX` is a CEILING, not a count — three at the very most,
 * fewer whenever the row is tight. This is the rule Figma's own cards follow:
 * its edge cases show three, two and two visible tags, because it collapses by
 * available space. A fixed number cannot do that. It either wastes room on a
 * card with a short name, or — the version this component shipped with — lets
 * the chips hold their width until the TITLE is what truncates, which is the
 * exact inversion of the documented order and the thing Figma's DO/DON'T frame
 * warns against.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC, NOT SHRINK-AND-SEE. The obvious implementation — render, check
 * for overflow, drop one, re-render — oscillates: removing a chip gives the
 * title room to grow, which takes the room back. So the budget is computed
 * from parts that do NOT depend on how many tags are showing:
 *
 *   budget = row width − the title at its natural width (capped) − the source
 *            − the `Locked`/`Restricted` tags − the gaps between them
 *
 * The title is measured at its NATURAL width via `scrollWidth`, which reports
 * the full string even while the ellipsis is on screen. That is what puts the
 * tags first in the yielding order: they are fitted into what is left AFTER
 * the title has been given everything it wants, up to its 540px ceiling.
 *
 * Chip widths come from a hidden probe row that renders every candidate at
 * full size. Measuring the visible chips instead would only ever tell us about
 * the ones already on screen, which is the wrong question.
 *
 * Reaching zero visible tags is a legitimate outcome, not a failure: at that
 * width the honest thing is one `+N` chip carrying all of them, rather than a
 * truncated name beside a tag that fits.
