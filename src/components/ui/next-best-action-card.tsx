/**
 * Next Best Action Card — AIMS OS Design System
 *
 * Source of truth: Figma `Design System - AIMS OS`, node 20206:316306 (the
 * "Next Best Action Card Content" component set), plus its two rules frames
 * (20257:7761, 20258:7787) and the Slideout section (20009:12610). Structure,
 * spacing, type sizes and every token were read from the file, Light and Dark
 * independently.
 *
 * Promoted out of `experimental/` by Michael (2026-09-07): it will grow more
 * variants and appear differently in different parts of the platform, which is
 * a component's job and not a candidate's.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 *
 * The proactive recommendation. It sits in its OWN Card Container directly
 * below the Entity Header — never inside it. The header identifies the
 * entity; this proposes what to do about it. Two records, two containers.
 * Sixteen products were reviewed for the Figma study and none of them puts
 * the recommendation in the record header.
 *
 * THE RULES THAT ARE STRUCTURAL, NOT CONVENTIONS
 *
 *   ONE AT A TIME. The prop is `item?`, singular. The engine has already
 *   prioritised, unified and discarded, so showing five is not trusting the
 *   engine — and stacked cards push the real content below the fold. This was
 *   `items: NextBestAction[]` with a `.map`, which is exactly how two
 *   recommendations rendered inside one container for three separate passes.
 *   The singular type is that rule made impossible to break.
 *
 *   NO RECOMMENDATION, NO CARD. `item` undefined renders NOTHING — not an
 *   empty card, not a placeholder, not a "nothing to recommend" message. It
 *   is not an empty state: there is nothing to say when there is nothing to
 *   do.
 *
 *   THE TITLE IS THE ACTION, NOT THE ENGINE. "Next Best Action" names the
 *   engine and already appears as the card's own label; repeating it in the
 *   title wastes the one line that carries the instruction.
 *
 *   IT ALWAYS DECLARES WHEN AND WHY. Timestamp plus rationale. Without a
 *   rationale it is an order, not a proposal.
 *
 *   NO ACCURACY DISCLAIMER. Other products hedge generated content with "may
 *   be inaccurate". A recommendation reaching this surface has passed the
 *   Council, so it declares its source instead of apologising.
 *
 *   ACCEPT ASSIGNS, IT NEVER EXECUTES. The agent executes, the human governs
 *   — never "Call now". And accepting still opens the detail first, because
 *   the card cannot guarantee it showed everything and committing without the
 *   record is accepting blind. There is no inline accept anywhere here.
 *
 *   DISMISS RESOLVES IN PLACE. It commits the user to nothing, so it needs no
 *   detail. The × hides the card for this session only and it returns on
 *   reload; nothing is stored and nothing is fed back to the engine.
 *
 * This is NOT the block that used to live inside the header. That one was a
 * filled purple surface with a HighlightIcon box, a context Tag and a
 * trailing chevron. Figma has none of those: the card is a plain surface, the
 * only colour is the purple label and the bullet, and the actions are real
 * buttons.
 *
 * NO SEVERITY AND NO COLOURS. There is no `severity`, no `dueContext`, no
 * `aiGenerated` and no `actionLabel`. Timing and urgency live in the COPY —
 * the rationale — never in a token: a card that colours itself by urgency
 * competes with the Entity Header's state badge and signal tags, which are
 * the platform's actual urgency channel.
 *
 * Tokens (Figma → repo, all pre-existing, none invented):
 *   Text/Purple              → --color-text-purple      #2c075c / #d8b4fe
 *   Text/Subtitle            → --color-text-subtitle    #2a2a2a / rgba(255,255,255,0.6)
 *   Text/Body                → --color-text-body        #5c5c5c / rgba(255,255,255,0.6)
 *   Surface/Primary/Default  → the DS Button primary variant, not hand-styled
 *
 * ONE DIVERGENCE FROM FIGMA'S PROSE, RESOLVED IN FAVOUR OF ITS INSTANCE
 *
 * The rules frame says the rationale is "ONE LINE, ALWAYS" and truncates with
 * a tooltip. The built instance sets that text node to auto-HEIGHT, which
 * wraps. The instance is what renders, so it wraps here — the same way the
 * instance settles source-and-tags on the Entity Header's stacked row.
 *
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED YET — do not mistake these for oversights
 *
 *   - The character limits are documented, not enforced: title 20/40/60,
 *     rationale 60/90/150, action label max 25. What the card should do when
 *     the engine returns less than the minimum is an open question with
 *     Engineering in Figma's own frame — it cannot invent the consequence.
 *   - The counter that leads to the list when more than one recommendation
 *     exists. Figma names it; nothing renders it yet.
